# Example of using AzApi with Ephemeral Values

This example is almost entirely based on the [example posted here](https://github.com/kewalaka/azapi-ephemeral-demo) by Stu Mace. The only change I made was to have the configuration create a new resource group using the `azurerm` provider.

Check out [Stu's blog on this topic](https://blog.kewalaka.nz/post/2025/06/ephemeral_azapi/) for more information.

Thanks Stu!
